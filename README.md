# Turbulence

This repository contains the Data and Code supporting the end-of-chapter exercises for the eBook:

> Ian Castro and Christina Vanderwel, 
[_Turbulent Flows: An Introduction,_](https://www.iop.org/) IOP, 2021.


The examples are  also used in the module <b>SESA6061 Turbulence</b> at the University of Southampton will be regularly updated and improved. 

Students are encouraged to try to solve the data analysis exercises on their own, before looking at the worked solutions; however, documented MATLAB codes are provided illustrating the solutions to each exercise. 

We hope to also provide solutions in other programming languagues such as Python in the near future. If you would like to contribute or suggest improvement, please contact the author at c.m.vanderwel@soton.ac.uk. 

All code is shared under the MIT license and you can share and adapt it freely.
