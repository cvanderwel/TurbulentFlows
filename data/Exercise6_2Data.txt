% Homogeneous Shear Flow Data from Tavoularis and Karnik (J. Fluid Mech, 204:457â€“478, 1989)
% available at https://torroja.dmt.upm.es/turbdata/agard/chapter3/HOM22/HOM22KT/
% This data is for case A, where Uc = 13 m/s, Shear = 84 s^-1.
% Tau is the non-dimensional downstream distance from the grid representing the total strain
% uu, vv, ww are the normal stresses (m^2/s^2)
% uv is the Reynolds stress (m^2/s^2)
